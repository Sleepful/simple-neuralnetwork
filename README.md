Neural networks
`ann.py` hand-written implementation of a simple neural network.
`sine2.py` more complex neural network written with TensorFlow.

* ann.py = Linear classification, approximates a given line in a plane by looking at a dataset of dots classified as being below or above the line, afterwards it is able to classify new dats
* sine.py = Similar as the previous one, this one uses tenserflow and it can approximate the sine function on a plane given a dataset of dots
